I built a website with a quiz game. The content of the questions is information about me and the user answers them with yes or no.

### Reflections and Comments

* How did this go, overall?

* At first, I felt that the task was complicated, but after reading what was required of the assignment and developing a plan, the task became less complicated, and it was good training in dealing with writing different codes.

* What observations or questions do you have about what youâ€™ve learned so far?

* I have a question, is it possible to add a file like .eslintrc.json file or change its name in VS but not in the terminal?

* How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?

* The task took about two and a half hours, but at first I thought I needed a full day.
