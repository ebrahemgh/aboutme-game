        Hello, I am Motasim Al-Azzam.<br/>
         I am a mechanical engineer, graduated from Al Hussein Bin Talal University last year with a very good rating grade.<br/>
         I gained volunteer experience during my studies at the university where I was Vice-Chairman of the academic committee <br/>
         in a team called the Direction team, which is a volunteer academic team established in the Department of Mechanical Engineering.<br/>
         my first work after graduation was with  “United Nations Office for Project Services” <br/>
         as a foreman on a 45-day school maintenance project in the Damkhi village of Amman Governorate.<br/>
         I loved the field of programming and I aspire to become a professional software developerIn the future.<br/>
